	abstract = {Praise for the Fourth Edition: "This book is . . . an excellent source of examples for regression analysis. It has been and still is readily readable and understandable." —Journal of the American Statistical Association Regression analysis is a conceptually simple method for investigating relationships among variables. Carrying out a successful application of regression analysis, however, requires a balance of theoretical results, empirical rules, and subjective judgment. Regression Analysis by Example, Fifth Edition has been expanded and thoroughly updated to reflect recent advances in the field. The emphasis continues to be on exploratory data analysis rather than statistical theory. The book offers in-depth treatment of regression diagnostics, transformation, multicollinearity, logistic regression, and robust regression.},

It has been suggested by some authors that multicollinearity should be controlled before attempting to measure influence of data point. In using ridge regression to mitigate the effect of multicollinearity, there arises a problem of choosing possible of ridge parameter that guarantees stable regression coefficients in the regression model. This paper seeks to check whether the choice of ridge parameter estimator influences the identified influential data points.},

	abstract = {We propose a procedure for the detection of multiple outliers in multivariate data. Let X be an n × p data matrix representing n observations on p variates. We first order the n observations, using an appropriately chosen robust measure of outlyingness, then divide the data set into two initial subsets: A ‘basic’ subset which contains p +1 ‘good’ observations and a ‘non-basic’ subset which contains the remaining n - p - 1 observations. Second, we compute the relative distance from each point in the data set to the centre of the basic subset, relative to the (possibly singular) covariance matrix of the basic subset. Third, we rearrange the n observations in ascending order accordingly, then divide the data set into two subsets: A basic subset which contains the first p + 2 observations and a non-basic subset which contains the remaining n - p - 2 observations. This process is repeated until an appropriately chosen stopping criterion is met. The final non-basic subset of observations is declared an outlying subset. The procedure proposed is illustrated and compared with existing methods by using several data sets. The procedure is simple, computationally inexpensive, suitable for automation, computable with widely available software packages, effective in dealing with masking and swamping problems and, most importantly, successful in identifying multivariate outliers.},

	abstract = {Gauging the robustness of regression estimates is especially important in small-sample analyses. Here, we examine recent developments in the detection and analysis of outliers and influential cases in multivariate studies. Specifically, we review five diagnostic procedures: partial regression plots, the “hat” matrix, studentized residuals, {DFITSi}, and {DFBETASij}. The main part of the article presents two empirical applications (drawn from recent cross-national studies) that show (a) how the diagnostic procedures can be incorporated into the research process, and (b) what we can learn from them. These applications serve to underscore the point that the diagnostics cannot be employed mechanically. Instead, once a case is diagnosed as influential, remedial action requires a firm substantive grounding. Although case deletion may be warranted in some circumstances, it is an extreme remedy of last resort that should not be routinely followed. The more fruitful approach is to ask why a given case is influential. As our applications indicate, the diagnostics can be helpful in isolating such problems as sample composition, specification error, and errors in measurement.},
